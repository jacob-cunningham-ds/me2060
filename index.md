## Purpose

This site contains notes, homeworks, and projects from the time I took ME 2060: Numerical Methods as a student. The site was created by myself using the content created by Dr. Inanc Senocak and Dr. Chengnian Xiao.

## Course Objectives

1. Demonstrate understanding of commonly used numerical methods in computational sciences.
2. Identify and apply suitable numerical methods to problems.
3. Assess the accuracy (errors) and limitations of a numerical method.
4. Implement and/or use numerical methods available in a scientific computing package.
